# Football-Guys
CMPSC 445 Machine Learning Final Project

# Introduction
Welcome to the Football Guys project! Here, we are creating a machine learning application that utilizes large NFL datasets ranging from player info to game outcomes. These are arranged in excel files that were found from Kaggle. Our main goal of Football Guys is to predict how well a team will perform during a given time. It may come in handy in times of drafting fantasy teams for trading players during the season or general aid in sports betting. To implement these ideas into our project, we can use a few concepts that we learned in class for processing these datasets for training and testing. We currently plan on using PCA, KNN, KMeans and a simple GUI to keep it as compact as we can. Essentially, the machine learning model will take in all that data from the excel files and run them through these concepts so that it can predict player and team rankings. 

# Work Process
To make the excel files work with the model, we had to manually clean up and add elements in the files. There were some major additions that had to be made to the games.csv, so we added in the rest of the scores to ensure maximum accuracy. A few other files did not have recent data, we cleaned it up by reducing the range of years to improve the overall predictions by keeping more recent data.
